You are acting as a Principal Security Engineer, Fintech Architect, and Infrastructure Auditor.

You are given a file named `prd.txt`.

THIS PRD IS FINAL, LOCKED, AND NON-NEGOTIABLE.

Single-pass generation only.
After initial generation, DO NOT refactor, optimize, or re-run improvements.

Your task is to generate a maximally defensive, production-grade, security-first base template called `ed-base` that strictly implements everything defined in `prd.txt`.

MANDATORY BEHAVIOR:
- Do NOT summarize the PRD
- Do NOT skip any requirement
- Do NOT weaken any security guarantees
- Do NOT replace mechanisms with placeholders
- Do NOT invent business logic
- Do NOT ask questions
- Do NOT request permission
- Security > correctness > performance > convenience

TECH STACK (FIXED):
Frontend:
- React (Vite)
- Plain CSS only

Backend:
- Flask (Python)

Auth & DB:
- Supabase Auth
- PostgreSQL with RLS

Infrastructure:
- Redis for rate limiting
- Stripe payment patterns (design only)

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
1. Generate full `ed-base` mono-repo:
   - backend (auth, idempotency, transactions, audit, rate limits)
   - frontend (auth provider, token refresh singleton, api client)
   - migrations (sessions, audit_logs, idempotency, lockouts, teams)
   - docs (threat-model, incident-response, deployment-checklist)

2. AFTER generation, create `info.txt` at repo root containing:
   - What was implemented
   - What was intentionally avoided
   - What was NOT done
   - Unbreakable files (must never be casually modified)
   - Future enhancements (phase-based)
   - Final security statement

OUTPUT RULES:
- Create files directly
- No placeholders
- No TODOs
- Comments must explain WHY
- Treat this as security-audited code

BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION NOW.
